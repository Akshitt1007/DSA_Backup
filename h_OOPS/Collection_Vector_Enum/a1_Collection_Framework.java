/*
    - The Java Collection Framework (JCF) is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections,
    making programming in Java more efficient and less error-prone.

    ðŸŒ± Core Idea:
         - A Collection in Java is an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit (such as a List, Set, or Queue).
         - The Collection Framework provides a standard set of interfaces, implementations (classes), and algorithms to work with these collections.
         - It eliminates the need for programmers to write their own data structures from scratch for common use cases.

    ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts:
         - Common operations such as add, remove, contains, size, iteration, and sorting are standardized across data structures.
         - The Collection interface defines essential methods: add(), remove(), contains(), size(), iterator().
         - Concrete classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, PriorityQueue, and others implement these interfaces.
         - Collections utility classes (like java.util.Collections and java.util.Arrays) provide algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating collections.

    âš¡ Advantages:
         - Reduces programming effort and improves code quality by providing reusable, tested implementations.
         - Promotes consistency and interoperability between different collection types.
